# üß† Morse Code Translator ‚Äì Python Project

## üîç Project Idea
A simple Python program that converts any English text to **Morse code**, a code that uses dots (`.`) and dashes (`-`) to represent letters, numbers, and symbols.

---

## üß± How Does the Program Work?

### üî§ 1. Definition of a Morse Code Table
We created a dictionary containing:
- English letters (A‚ÄìZ)
- Numbers (0‚Äì9)
- Some special symbols

Each key corresponds to its Morse code value.

### ‚å®Ô∏è 2. User Input
The user enters any English text they want to translate.

### üîÅ 3. Converting Letters to Morse Code
- Each letter is converted to **uppercase**.
- If the letter exists in the dictionary, it is converted and added to the result.
- Unsupported characters are either skipped or handled appropriately.

### üì§ 4. Result Display
The translated text is printed in Morse code, with each character separated by spaces.

## üí° Example

If the user enters:
HELLO WORLD

The result is:
.... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
